    Below is a breakdown of the diagnoses of patients with a diagnosis. Patients without diagnoses are not included in statistics. Below is the break down of diagnoses
    into groups and their associated percentage of the patient base. You can filter the set by Physician. Filtering limits patients to that physician only, effectively giving the
    breakdown of diagnoses by that physician across their patients.

    In the following section, we will look at patients' response to their level of energy over time. Before an appointment, they are asked to
    submit a pre-checkup questionnaire. One of the questions asks for the patient to rate their level of energy from 1 to 9 with 1 being lowest
    and 9 being highest amount of energy. The following percentage is the average shift in level of energy over time across all patients. You can
    filter by physician which gives that physician's patients' net energy shift.
